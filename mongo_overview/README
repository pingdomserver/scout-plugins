Provides overview stats of a MongoDB installation.

Replica set metrics are prefixed with 'replset_*' in their name. These stats simply won't report for nodes that are not members of replica sets.  It's recommended to set alerts in production for 'replset_replication_lag' > 300 and for 'replset_member_healthy' == 'False.'
