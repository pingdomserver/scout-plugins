Forked from and uses code from ScoutApp plugin mongo_overview by [John Nunemaker](http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/07/13/mongo-scout-plugins/)

Provides overview stats of a MongoDB replica set and its individual nodes.

Replica set metrics are prefixed with 'replset_*' in their name. These stats simply won't report for nodes that are not members of replica sets.  It's recommended to set alerts in production for 'replset_replication_lag' > 300 and for 'replset_member_healthy' == 'False.'
